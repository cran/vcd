Description: Visualization techniques, data sets, summary and inference
        procedures aimed particularly at categorical data. Special
        emphasis is given to highly extensible grid graphics. The
        package was package was originally inspired by the book 
	"Visualizing Categorical Data" by Michael Friendly and is 
	now the main support package for a new book, 
	"Discrete Data Analysis with R" by Michael Friendly and 
	David Meyer (2015).
