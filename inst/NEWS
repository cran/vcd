Changes in Version 1.2-11

  o Bug fix: `gamma'-argument removed from hcl2hex()

Changes in Version 1.2-10

  o Add aperm method for structable objects

  o For use with shading_Friendly(), shading_hsv() now sets the line type of
    borders corresponding to abs(residual)<eps to lty[1] in addition to setting
    color to line_color.

  o In fourfold(), modified default colors[3:4] for non-significant log odds ratios
    to be more visually distinct from the fully saturated colors[5:6] for significant ones.

  o In fourfold(), allow the function to work with >3-dimensional tables, by restructuring
    all strata dimensions into a single combined 3rd dimension.

  o In fourfold(), modified defaults for mfrow/mfcol to give landscape display, nr <= nc, 
    rather than nr >= nc. If length(dim(x))>3, set nr=dim(x)[3].
 
Changes in Version 1.2-9

  o Fixed Ord_plot() for devices where the default filling is
    "white" and not "transparent" by explicitly setting it to
    the latter.

  o Bug fix in as.table.structable, returning the table in a different order
    than defined in the structable object, confusing in particular
    plot.structable.

  o add parameter to ternaryplot() to control the positioning of the
    plot labels.

Changes in Version 1.2-8

  o Small bug fixes in handling of some graphical parameters.


Changes in Version 1.2-7

  o Corrected df handling in goodfit() with ML estimation:
    only non-zero cells are used. This is backward compatible
    with versions <= 1.2-4.
    
  o Fixed bug in goodfit() for binomial distribution with
    specified "size" parameter (introduced in 1.2-5).


Changes in Version 1.2-6

  o Small typo in doc of co_table.


Changes in Version 1.2-5

  o Bundesliga data set has been augmented with the results of the
    seasons 2006/7, 2007/8, 2008/9 (thanks to Torsten Hothorn).

  o goodfit() was modified to treat zero cells better: "Internal"
    zero cells (i.e., counts below the maximal observed count that
    did not occur in the sample) are retained (and not dropped as
    before). "Trailing" zero cells (i.e., counts above the maximal
    observed count) are still not considered. The documentation now
    points out the problems with the minimum-chi-squared method in
    the latter situation.

  o sieve() now accepts a gp_tile argument to control the appearance of
    the cells (apart from the sieve color)


Changes in Version 1.2-4

  o Bug fix: labeling arguments were incorrectly handled when the options
    were not provided as named vector

  o ternaryplot() now makes use of the `cex` argument also for 
    the rendering of optional labels, if any


Changes in Version 1.2-3

  o hcl-colors.pdf removed from source ball (vignette now in
    colorspace)


Changes in Version 1.2-2

  o strucplot() now accepts a `df` argument that is passed to the
    shading functions. Also, expected values are no longer computed
    if residuals are given.


Changes in Version 1.2-1

  o Fixed a bug in labeling (incorrect handling of some parameters)


Changes in Version 1.2-0

  o Moved color palettes from vcd to colorspace, including
    vignette("hcl-colors"). Package colorspace is (as before) loaded
    automatically with vcd.
